# Things to do
- Add support for strings
- Tail recursion optimization?
- Add support for "begin"
- Add support for "set!"
- Add support for "cond" (what's the difference between "cond" and "if" really? With cond it's possible to "do many if:s at once".)
- Add support for integers with unlimited size (because Lisp doesn't have a limit?)
- Add support for decimals.
- Group related tests and move to separate files.
- Add support for macros.
